# Structural-Analysis-Software
Developed a lightweight structural analysis tool that automates load cases, reactions, and shear/moment diagrams for small to mid-scale projects. Fast geometry/material input, code-based safety factors, and report/plot exports cut manual calculation time and errors, enabling quicker design decisions for structural teams. Client-ready batch exports.
